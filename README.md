# Underwater Rescue Robot

## Overview

The Underwater Rescue Robot project aims to develop an autonomous robot equipped with advanced computer vision and machine learning capabilities to assist in underwater rescue operations. With the goal of improving emergency response for drowning incidents, our project leverages cutting-edge technology to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of rescue missions.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Navigation:** Utilizes advanced navigation algorithms to autonomously navigate underwater environments and locate individuals in distress.
- **Object Recognition:** Employs computer vision techniques to detect and recognize objects, including individuals, obstacles, and landmarks underwater.
- **Real-time Communication:** Establishes reliable communication channels for transmitting data between the robot and external systems, enabling remote operation and monitoring.
- **Mission Planning:** Facilitates mission planning and management with features for defining rescue missions, optimizing routes, and allocating tasks dynamically.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for operators to monitor the robot's status, control its movements, and interact with onboard systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, C++
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow, ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **Communication Protocols:** MQTT, WebSocket
- **Hardware:** Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Depth Sensors, Cameras
